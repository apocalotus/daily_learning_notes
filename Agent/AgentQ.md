# Key Components of Agent Q

## Guided Search with MCTS
autonomously generates data by exploring different actions and web-pages, balancing exploration and exploitation. 

? generation using MCTS ?

expands the action space using high sampling temperature and diverse prompting

## AI Self-Critique
AI-based self-critique provides valuable feedback, refining the agent's decision-making process

long horizon tasks, where sparse signals often lead to learning difficulties
## DPO
the DPO algorithm fine-tunes the model by constructing preference pairs from MCTS-generated data
